## Why this GitHub exists
This GitHub is here to host **selective, shareable artifacts** when we have the bandwidth: in-house 2.5D pixel art tools, reference implementations, and talk materials. Anything that can be useful outside our production codebase.

What you should **not** expect here:
- full production game code
- proprietary pipelines, licensed tech/assets, platform SDK integrations


## Our debut title: The Last Night
<a href="https://oddtales.net/thelastnight/">The Last Night</a> is a 2.5D cinematic platformer set later this century, in a world where AI has automated nearly every aspect of life.

Players control **Charlie**, a young man struggling to accept that the civilization he grew up in has faded, replaced by a new order optimized for leisure, comfort, and entertainment.
