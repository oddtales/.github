# Odd Tales — .github

This repository configures organization-wide GitHub standards for Odd Tales.

## Purpose
The `.github` repository is a meta-repo for GitHub configuration. It also holds:
- Selective tools, tech demonstrations, or findings that support **publications and tech talks**.
- No development pipelines, main game code, or collaborative activities.

## What’s Here?
- Supporting code/tools from Odd Tales talks & publications.
- Resources related to our creative process:
  - 2.5D pixel-art tools, Unity workflow guides, shaders...
- The organization profile (visit: https://github.com/oddtales).

## Our Focus
Odd Tales focuses on:
**Key Deliverables. Not collaborative open-source.** 

## What's NOT here:
1. Proprietary game source (e.g., our main BitBucket repositories).
2. PR workflows or collaborative open-source development.
